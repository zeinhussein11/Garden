        The <span class="highlight">Garden Project</span> is more than just a website – it is a digital celebration of nature’elegance and serenity. We built this site to show how HTML and CSS can bring beauty to the web just like flowers do in real life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by the soothing colors and calmness of nature, our garden aims to provide a peaceful online space. Here, you can explore various types of flowers, understand their meaning, and enjoy a relaxing digital experience.

        Created with passion by <span class="highlight">[Zakaria]</span>, this project is part of a mission to combine creativity, nature, and technology into one smart and simple space. Whether you're a plant lover or a beginner in web development, this garden is made for you.</p>
<p>Our garden is a shared and peaceful space where everyone is welcome. To keep it clean and beautiful, we follow a few simple rules that help us work together in harmony.</p>

<p>1 we respect the plants and flowers. No one should pick the flowers or damage any part of the garden. Every plant has its purpose and adds to the beauty of nature.</p>

<p>2 always keep the garden clean. Do not throw trash on the ground. Use the waste bins provided, and help us keep the area fresh and green.</p>

<p>3 water the plants gently and only when needed. Over-watering can damage the roots, and under-watering can dry the plants. Balance is key in caring for nature.</p>

<p>4 we do not allow loud noise or playing music with high volume. The garden is a quiet place where people come to relax, read, or reflect in peace.</p>

<p>5 children are welcome, but they must be guided by adults. Running or playing roughly in the garden is not allowed as it may harm the plants and disturb others.</p>

<p>6 tools and equipment should be used carefully and returned to their place after use. Everyone shares responsibility for keeping the garden organized.</p>

<p>7 be kind and helpful to others. Smile, greet fellow gardeners, and share knowledge. Together, we make the garden a better place for all of us.</p>
